            "content": "Twitter has lost almost half of its advertising revenue since it was bought by Elon Musk for $44bn (£33.6bn) last October, its owner has revealed. He said the company had not seen the increase in sales that had been expected in June, but added that July was a “bit more promising”. Mr Musk sacked about half of Twitter’s 7,500 staff when he took over in 2022 in an effort to cut costs. Rival app Threads now has 150 million users, according to some estimates. Its in-built connection to Instagram automatically gives the Meta-designed platform access to a potential two billion users. Meanwhile, Twitter is struggling under a heavy debt load. Cash flow remains negative, Mr Musk said at the weekend, although the billionaire did not put a time frame on the 50% drop in ad revenue. In a tweet he said: “Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.” After laying off thousands of employees and cutting cloud service bills, Mr Musk said Twitter was on track to post $3bn (£2.29bn) in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1bn in 2021. The development is the latest sign the aggressive cost-cutting measures have not been enough to ignite a return of advertisers who fled after changes to its content moderation rules. That is despite an interview Mr Musk gave to the BBC in April, in which he suggested that most had returned to the site. Read Full Story ….

            "description": "Out of 630 global MLIV Pulse contributors, 54 percent flagged the heightened risk of industry competition while 26 percent picked the behavior and decisions of its mercurial chief as a key concern for Tesla shareholders.",
            "content": "Right on cue, Tesla skeptics are pushing back after this year's sizzling $500 billion (roughly Rs. 41,05,550 crore) rally. Rival automakers pouncing on booming demand for electric vehicles pose the biggest challenge for Tesla over the next two years just as Elon Musk appears distracted thanks to his high-profile ventures, from social media and space travel to artificial intelligence. So say respondents to the latest Markets Live Pulse survey. Out of 630 global MLIV Pulse contributors, 54 percent flagged the heightened risk of industry competition while 26 percent picked the behaviour and decisions of its mercurial chief as a key concern for Tesla shareholders. “Musk is just such an unpredictable person, that I would count it among one of the top risks for Tesla,” Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management, said in an interview. As profit margins thin, some 67 percent of survey participants said the billionaire executive should focus more on the carmaker. Their warning comes in the wake of a seemingly improbable 128 percent Tesla rally this year, fuelled by renewed investor appetite for the tech megacaps and Musk's prediction that the era of fully autonomous vehicles is nigh. Even though Tesla currently enjoys sizable lead over other companies, be it an established carmaker or a startup, a big part of its remarkably high market valuation rests on the assumption that it will be able to maintain this dominance in a future where EVs are more commonplace. Yet Tesla rivals are picking up the pace. Just earlier this month, China's BYD set a sales record for the second quarter, and delivered 352,163 fully electric vehicles. That shows how rapidly it has gained ground on Tesla, which handed over 466,140 EVs to customers worldwide — also an all-time high. The counterargument goes that a slew of Tesla's rivals are still struggling with teething issues. For instance, Ford Motor's US electric vehicle sales fell in the second quarter, after it had to pause production early this year at the Mexican factory that builds the Mustang Mach-E. Despite that, analysts and investors warn that Tesla's current advantage can erode quickly as government policies like the US's Inflation Reduction Act encourage other automakers to embrace EVs. With competitors stepping up their game, Tesla's famously expensive shares — trading at 75 times forward earnings — leave little room for error. In comparison, GM trades at about 6 times of estimated profits and Ford at about 9 times. “Competition is the most important risk factor for Tesla longer term, and even mediocre execution for the crop of around 100 new EVs coming to market this year will put pressure on Tesla,” said Craig Irwin, analyst at Roth Capital Partners. “The current lead over competition is very real, but we need to understand how this shrinks.” Defending the market share comes with a cost. Around 63 percent of the MLIV Pulse respondents expect the company to continue to lower prices in order to capture higher volumes. As a result, its hefty profit margin is already taking a hit. More cuts will likely leave the margins even thinner, and narrow the gap with other auto companies. The impact of all the recent price cuts on Tesla's profits will be clear this Wednesday when the company reports second-quarter results. The average profit estimate for the quarter has come down 29 percent from where they were six months ago. “Winning stocks grow revenue and margins. Both are necessary,” said Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research. Meanwhile the “Musk-risk” embedded in Tesla shares came into a sharp focus last year when the billionaire engaged in a highly public bid for social-media platform Twitter , and sold off big chunks of Tesla stock to pay for the acquisition. The pressure from the sales and worries that Musk had become too distracted to run Tesla weighed heavily on the shares at that time. Since then, Twitter's own value has dwindled as well. About 67 percent of the survey respondents said they don't expect Twitter will ever be worth as much as Musk paid for it. © 2023 Bloomberg LP",

            "content": "Investors want Elon Musk to focus on Tesla as EV race intensifies Following Tesla Inc.’s impressive $500 billion rally this year, skeptics have emerged to question the sustainability of the company’s success. These sceptics point to rival automakers who are capitalizing on the surging demand for electric vehicles, posing a significant challenge to Tesla in the coming years. Additionally, some argue that Elon Musk’s involvement in various high-profile ventures, such as social media, space travel, and artificial intelligence, may divert his attention from leading Tesla effectively. The rise of electric vehicles has attracted the attention of traditional automakers, who are now actively investing in and developing their own electric vehicle offerings. As the market becomes more crowded with competition, Tesla will face increasing pressure to maintain its market share and stay ahead in terms of innovation, quality, and affordability. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about Elon Musk’s involvement in other ventures, which could divide his focus and impact his ability to steer Tesla’s growth. Musk’s diverse interests, including his prominent role in companies like SpaceX and Neuralink, have made sceptics question whether he can devote sufficient attention and resources to Tesla’s day-to-day operations and long-term strategy. However, it’s worth noting that Tesla has proven resilient in the face of skepticism before. The company’s ability to disrupt the automotive industry and establish itself as a leader in the electric vehicle market has been impressive. Tesla has consistently demonstrated its innovation, technological prowess, and ability to capture consumer demand. While the challenges posed by rival automakers and concerns about Elon Musk’s multiple ventures are legitimate points of discussion, it remains to be seen how they will ultimately impact Tesla’s trajectory. The company has shown a remarkable ability to adapt, evolve, and overcome obstacles in the past. As the electric vehicle market continues to grow, competition will undoubtedly intensify, but Tesla’s early-mover advantage, brand recognition, and dedicated customer base could provide a strong foundation for future success. Ultimately, the market will determine Tesla’s fate based on its ability to deliver exceptional products, maintain a competitive edge, and navigate the evolving landscape of the automotive industry. According to the latest Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents expressed concerns about Tesla’s future. Out of 630 global contributors to the survey, 54% identified the increased risk of industry competition as a significant challenge for the company. The rising number of rival automakers entering the electric vehicle market threatens Tesla’s market share and dominance. Another key concern highlighted by 26% of the respondents was the behavior and decisions of Tesla’s enigmatic CEO, Elon Musk. Musk’s unpredictable nature and involvement in various ventures outside of Tesla have raised questions about his ability to effectively lead the company. Shareholders are wary of any potential distractions or negative impacts Musk’s actions may have on Tesla’s performance and long-term prospects. These survey results indicate that industry competition and the leadership dynamics surrounding Elon Musk are perceived as potential hurdles for Tesla moving forward. However, it’s essential to consider that survey results represent the opinions and perspectives of respondents at a specific point in time. The market is dynamic, and Tesla’s performance and ability to address these concerns will ultimately shape its future trajectory. Tesla has a track record of defying skeptics and achieving remarkable growth and innovation. It has consistently demonstrated its ability to overcome challenges and maintain its position as a leader in the electric vehicle market. Whether the concerns expressed in the survey will materialize as significant obstacles for the company remains uncertain, as Tesla continues to evolve and navigate the competitive landscape under Musk’s leadership.Matthew Tuttle, the CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, expressed his concerns about Elon Musk’s unpredictability and regarded it as one of the top risks for Tesla. In an interview, Tuttle emphasized the need for Musk to focus more on the carmaker, especially as profit margins become thinner. The sentiment echoed by Tuttle is reflected in the survey results, where 67% of participants believe that Musk should prioritize Tesla and devote more attention to the company. Despite the concerns, Tesla has experienced an astonishing 128% rally this year, driven by investor enthusiasm for technology megacaps and Musk’s assertion that fully autonomous vehicles are on the horizon. The juxtaposition of Tesla’s soaring stock performance and the survey respondents’ call for Musk’s increased focus on the automaker suggests a degree of caution and a desire for stability among investors. As Tesla’s valuation continues to rise, there is a growing expectation that the company’s profitability and operational execution should align with its market success. The profitability aspect is particularly pertinent as Tesla faces challenges related to cost management, competition, and scaling production. With profit margins thinning, investors are keen to see Musk prioritize the core aspects of Tesla’s business to ensure sustainable growth and profitability. Musk’s bold predictions and ambitious ventures have undoubtedly contributed to Tesla’s allure and market appeal. However, investors and market participants are now urging him to balance his visionary endeavors with a renewed focus on the fundamental aspects of the carmaker’s operations. Ultimately, the dynamics between Musk’s ventures, his leadership style , and Tesla’s performance will continue to be closely scrutinized by investors and market observers. As Tesla navigates the evolving automotive landscape and strives to maintain its position as a leader in the electric vehicle market, the role and focus of its mercurial chief executive will remain a topic of interest and discussion. While Tesla currently holds a significant lead over its competitors, whether established carmakers or startups, a substantial portion of its high market valuation is based on the expectation that it will maintain its dominance as electric vehicles become more prevalent. However, Tesla’s rivals are rapidly catching up, posing a challenge to the company’s market position. For instance, China’s BYD Co. recently achieved a sales record in the second quarter, delivering 352,163 fully electric vehicles. This demonstrates the remarkable progress BYD has made and how it has narrowed the gap with Tesla, which also reached an all-time high by delivering 466,140 EVs globally. The increasing competition in the electric vehicle market underscores the need for Tesla to remain vigilant and innovative. While Tesla has enjoyed a head start and established a strong brand presence, other companies are actively ramping up their electric vehicle production and expanding their market share. To maintain its dominant position, Tesla will have to continue to invest in research and development, improve its production efficiency, and enhance its product offerings. Differentiating itself through technological advancements, superior range, charging infrastructure, and customer experience will be crucial for Tesla to fend off competition and retain its market leadership. The growing sales figures of companies like BYD indicate that the electric vehicle market is expanding rapidly, with multiple players vying for a share of the growing demand. As the industry matures and more options become available to consumers, Tesla’s ability to deliver innovative products, maintain its brand appeal, and effectively address the evolving market dynamics will be critical. Tesla’s ongoing success and market dominance are contingent on its ability to adapt, respond to competition, and consistently deliver value to its customers. The race to lead the electric vehicle market is intensifying, and Tesla will need to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation to secure its position in an increasingly competitive landscape. Tesla’s competitors are still facing challenges and teething issues in their electric vehicle offerings. For example, Ford Motor Co. experienced a decline in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the second quarter due to production pauses at its Mexican factory, which impacted the Mustang Mach-E production. However, analysts and investors caution that Tesla’s current advantage in the market is not guaranteed to last. Government policies, such as the proposed U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, can incentivize and encourage other automakers to ramp up their efforts in the electric vehicle space. As competition intensifies and rivals improve their offerings, Tesla’s market share could erode rapidly. One aspect that investors closely consider is Tesla’s valuation. The company’s shares are famously expensive, trading at 75 times forward earnings. This leaves little room for error or setbacks. In comparison, traditional automakers like General Motors (GM) and Ford trade at much lower price-to-earnings multiples, with GM at about 6 times estimated profits and Ford at about 9 times. The valuation discrepancy raises concerns among some analysts and investors, who argue that Tesla’s current valuation assumes continued dominance and success without room for potential challenges or competition catching up. Any missteps or delays in Tesla’s growth trajectory could impact investor sentiment and put pressure on the company’s stock price. While Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and maintain a leading position in the electric vehicle market, the evolving landscape and increasing competition require constant vigilance and adaptability. The valuation of Tesla’s shares reflects high expectations for the company, and any deviation from those expectations could have an impact on its market performance. As the industry evolves and government policies shape the market, the competitive landscape for electric vehicles is likely to change rapidly. Tesla will need to continue to deliver on its promises, differentiate itself through technology and product offerings, and navigate the challenges of scaling production to sustain its market leadership position in the face of increasing competition.According to Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, competition poses the most significant long-term risk for Tesla. He suggests that even mediocre execution by the approximately 100 new electric vehicles (EVs) entering the market this year could exert pressure on Tesla. While Tesla currently enjoys a substantial lead, it is essential to consider how this lead may diminish over time. Defending market share against increasing competition can come at a cost. In the MLIV Pulse survey, around 63% of respondents expect Tesla to continue lowering prices to capture higher volumes. This strategy, aimed at maintaining market dominance, is impacting the company’s profit margin. Further price cuts would likely result in even thinner margins, narrowing the gap between Tesla and other auto manufacturers. The pressure to lower prices stems from the necessity to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. As more automakers introduce their EVs, price competitiveness becomes crucial in attracting customers. Tesla’s pursuit of market share, combined with the need to stimulate demand, may result in ongoing pricing adjustments that impact its profitability. Tesla has been known for its robust profit margins, but continued price reductions could challenge these margins further. As competitors enter the market with their own EV offerings, Tesla may face pricing pressures that erode its historically high profit margins. This would bring Tesla’s margins closer to those of other auto companies, potentially diminishing one of its differentiating factors. Striking a balance between market share and profitability is a delicate challenge for Tesla. While capturing higher volumes is important, the company must also ensure sustainable profitability to support its growth and ongoing investments in research, development, and infrastructure. As Tesla continues to navigate the evolving EV market and fierce competition, it must carefully manage its pricing strategies and monitor its impact on its profit margins. Finding ways to maintain a healthy balance between market share, competitive pricing, and profitability will be crucial for Tesla’s long-term success.The effect of recent price reductions on Tesla’s profitability will become evident when the company releases its second-quarter results. This Wednesday’s report will provide insights into the impact of pricing decisions on the company’s financial performance. Analysts have adjusted their profit estimates for the quarter, with the average estimate having declined by 29% over the past six months. Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research emphasizes the importance of both revenue growth and profit margins for successful stocks. Sustained revenue growth and healthy profit margins are crucial for the long-term success of companies like Tesla. As Tesla continues to navigate the competitive landscape and address pricing pressures, striking the right balance between revenue growth and profitability will be vital. While capturing market share and stimulating demand are important, maintaining healthy profit margins is equally essential to sustain the company’s growth trajectory and support its ongoing research, development, and expansion investments. The second-quarter results will show how Tesla’s pricing strategy has impacted its financial performance. Investors and analysts will closely analyze the revenue figures, profit margins, and management’s commentary to gauge the effectiveness of Tesla’s approach and its implications for the company’s future trajectory. Ultimately, achieving a balance between revenue growth and profit margins is a key challenge for Tesla. Striking the right balance will require ongoing assessment, adjustment, and innovation to sustain the company’s position as a leader in the electric vehicle market and deliver long-term value to its shareholders. The “Musk-risk” associated with Tesla shares gained attention last year when Elon Musk engaged in a highly publicized bid for the social media platform Twitter. Musk sold significant portions of his Tesla stock to finance the acquisition, which raised concerns among investors about his focus and ability to effectively manage Tesla. These factors weighed heavily on Tesla’s shares during that period. Furthermore, it is worth noting that since the time of the bid, the value of Twitter itself has declined. According to the MLIV Pulse survey, around 67% of respondents do not anticipate Twitter’s value ever reaching the amount Musk paid for it. The MLIV Pulse survey, conducted by Bloomberg’s Markets Live team, gathers opinions from Bloomberg News readers through the terminal and online platforms. The survey provides valuable insights into the perspectives and sentiments of market participants. This week’s survey topic focuses on “What’s next for Wall Street?” inviting respondents to share their views on the matter. Such surveys contribute to a broader understanding of market dynamics and provide a platform for readers to express their opinions on relevant topics. It is worth noting that surveys represent the opinions of the respondents at a specific point in time and do not necessarily reflect the future trajectory or outcomes. Market dynamics and events can evolve, leading to different perspectives and outcomes over time.",

However, Musk, and his ardent followers often fail to see what really made advertisers pull out of Twitter - his own erratic policies and antagonising tweets Elon Musk recently revealed that Twitter, despite all of his efforts, remains cash flow negative. Although Musk has blamed Twitter’s older debts and a 50 per cent dip in advertising revenue for this, there are several other factors behind Twitter’s increasingly worrisome financial health. Unsurprisingly for anyone who has been following the developments of the platform since its acquisition by Elon Musk, most of these issues are the result of Musk’s own policy. Twitter’s Monetary Woes Twitter saw a massive advertiser pullout when Elon Musk took over the social media platform, terminated nearly 10,000 employees, including contractors, and changed content moderation policies in such a way that he got into soup with the EU, as well as several other governments. Related Articles Elon Musk drops another bomb, will limit TweetDeck access only to Twitter Blue subscribers Twitter ‘cheated’ thousands it fired out of their severance, Elon Musk owes over $500 million People have raised several questions over Twitter’s financials, all of which have stemmed from Elon Musk’s erratic and sometimes bizarre actions. Apart from getting evicted from several prominent offices for not paying rent, Twitter under Musk has been accused of not paying vendors, ranging from Google for their cloud services to basic staffing vendors. Then there is the fact that Twitter had hedged a major bet on Twitter Blue. Musk had hoped that although not every daily active user would sign up for their premium verification service, the number would still run into the millions or tens of millions. However, frustratingly for Musk, the number of people who actually subscribed to Twitter Blue has just managed to cross a million a few weeks ago. With an active user base of over 250 million people daily the number of Twitter Blue subscribers isn’t even a paltry 1 per cent. Following Twitter laying off thousands of employees and cutting cloud service bills, Musk said Twitter was on track to post $3bn in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1bn in 2021. Dwindling Ad Revenues When Musk had taken over Twitter, there was a mass exodus of advertisers from the platform. Several reports suggested that of the top 100 advertisers, over 50 per cent had left within weeks of Musk taking over the social media platform. Although Musk had reported that most advertisers were back on the platform and that they were on track to close the deficit between their 2021 and 2023 earnings, that has not panned out the way Musk and his team had hoped for. One of the biggest reasons why advertisers have pulled out of Twitter, is Musk himself. Fed up of what the American right-wing calls “Woke” culture, Musk took a few steps with Twitter that would antagonise the American left. In the process, however, he turned Twitter into a platform that even more toxic than it used to be. Studies have shown that in the months following Twitter’s takeover, hate speech on the platform grew substantially. Things turned even worse for Twitter, when Musk stopped content moderation, and indirectly and inadvertently, let holocaust deniers post all sorts of ridiculous statements, denying the holocaust. What was even more egregious, however, was Musk’s refusal to suppress hate speech and holocaust deniers on the platform. A New Challenge By Threads Twitter’s dwindling revenue may not have been that big a concern for Elon Musk had Meta not launched Threads and got the response that it did. Within a week of its launch, it already had amassed over half of Twitter’s daily active users. And because Threads is so well integrated with Meta’s Instagram, it is only bound to grow exponentially more. More than users flocking to Threads, Musk fears that more and more advertisers will flock to threads. Having said that, we must remember who Musk hired as Twitter’s new CEO – Linda Yaccarino is an advertising veteran and will be vital in bringing back advertisers to Twitter. Given that she took charge of her position only recently, it remains to be seen how well she performs in her role and how much revenue Twitter make from advertisers going forward.

            "content": "Elon Musk’s new startup is \"definitely in competition” with OpenAI, the billionaire said on Friday during a discussion on Twitter Spaces. Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is his latest salvo against OpenAI, currently the buzziest and best-funded player in the fast-growing industry. During the discussion, Musk and staffers of his new startup spoke in lofty terms about the mission of xAI. Though it does not yet have any products, the startup unveiled a new website this week, and has the goal of safely developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI. The plan is \"to build a good AGI with the overarching purpose of just trying to understand the universe,” Musk said. Later, he added, \"I guess you could reform the xAI mission statement as: ‘What the hell is really going on?’ That’s our goal.” The concept of AGI, technology able to understand or learn tasks that humans can, has delighted and terrified scientists – even though it’s still only theoretical. On Friday, Musk’s new employees were bullish on the technology. Greg Yang, a former Microsoft Corp. engineer, compared the current state of AI development to the invention of quantum physics and general relativity. At times during the conversation, some of Musk’s statements bordered on the outlandish. \"Why is there not massive evidence of aliens?” he asked at one point. Musk has had a famously hot-and-cold relationship with artificial intelligence. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, then a few years later left its board, and has criticized the company. In March, the billionaire added his name to a call for a six-month pause on some AI development - then less than six month later, he officially launched xAI. The 12 early staffers of xAI, including Musk, are all men and all have a background in the industry. A majority previously worked at Alphabet Inc.’s Google and DeepMind in some capacity. One concern in the industry has been the relative concentration of AI research. One xAI staffer - Kyle Kosic, formerly of OpenAI – said he was looking forward to more competition in the field. \"The reason I’m particularly excited about xAI is that I think the biggest danger of AI is monopolization by a couple of entities,” Kosic said. – Bloomberg",

Not happening , a self-confessed troll and someone who explicitly states they post parody and satire news said, “Twitter to introduce “profile viewers” similar to LinkedIn which allows users to see who visited their profiles in the last 24 hours.” “Twitter Blue Subscribers are allowed to turn on “Private Profile Browsing” for anonymous browsing.” With the post soon taking off and gaining traction on Twitter, it eventually made its way onto the timeline of Twitter owner Elon Musk himself. Immediately shutting down the claim, he responded with a very simple “not happening.” Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. To which Esparaza , “Man I don’t think Elon and I are ever gonna be besties after this troll.” Interestingly enough, despite not being a real feature, many in response to Esparaza’s tweet were interested in the idea of the feature on Twitter. In addition, LinkedIn, which is where this feature is lifted from, has a “premium” subscription program users can buy to view a full list of who has viewed your account. Which in Elon’s rush to make Twitter profitable, may very well be an attractive feature to have down the line. But of yet, the owner himself has confirmed nothing of this nature is in the works.",

            "content": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has unveiled his new artificial intelligence startup called xAI. Making the announcement on Twitter, Musk stated that the company’s objective is to “understand reality.” Although he provided no further details about xAI’s plans, the startup’s website mentions that it aims to comprehend the true nature of the universe. xAI is a separate entity from X Corp, the rebranded name of Twitter. However, the startup emphasizes its intention to work closely with X Corp, Tesla, other companies owned by Musk, and various organizations to make progress towards its mission. The website reveals the names of xAI’s employees, with Musk leading the team and Dan Hendrycks, the director of the Centre for AI Safety, serving as an advisor. The team consists of individuals who have previously worked at prominent organizations such as DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Tesla, and the University of Toronto. According to xAI’s website, the team has made significant contributions to the field of AI. They claim to have worked on and led the development of groundbreaking projects, including AlphaStar, AlphaCode, Inception, Minerva, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. xAI is a small team of experts who emphasize the importance of iterating on ideas, challenging each other, and shipping quickly. The company acknowledges that it is in competition with industry giants like Google and OpenAI. Also recognizing that healthy competition fosters honesty among companies. Elon Musk envisions AI to be beneficial for both consumers and businesses. In a Q&A session, Musk addressed various aspects of xAI. He stated that public tweets, including text, images, and videos. This will be used for training, emphasizing the need for self-generated content for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The motivations behind starting xAI stem from the pursuit of truth, and Musk expressed a commitment to transparency and a willingness to go to prison for the public good if the government interferes in ways that go against the public interest. xAI differentiates itself from other AI companies by avoiding biases towards market incentives. Also seeking answers that may be controversial but true. The company aims to improve models’ factual accuracy, reasoning abilities, and understanding of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, xAI plans to allow verified, real humans to vote on the future direction of the company.
